# About

Yororen UI is a reusable UI Components + Widgets library built on top of Zed’s `gpui`.

Goals:

- Provide a consistent, theme-driven design system.
- Make performance-friendly UI the default (especially for scrollable lists).
- Offer primitives (components) and containers/behaviors (widgets) that compose well.

Non-goals:

- This is not a full application framework; it focuses on UI building blocks.
